# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

**An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.**

## Week 01: "C"

C. Source Code. Machine Code. Compiler. Correctness, Design, Style. Visual Studio Code. Syntax Highlighting. Escape Sequences. Header Files. Libraries. Manual Pages. Types. Conditionals. Variables. Loops. Linux. Graphical User Interface (GUI). Command-Line Interface (CLI). Constants. Comments. Pseudocode. Operators. Integer Overflow. Floating-Point Imprecision.

In this lesson, you learned how to apply the building blocks you learned in Scratch to the C programming language. You learned…

-   How to create your first program in C.
-   How to use the command line.
-   About predefined functions that come natively with C.
-   How to use variables, conditionals, and loops.
-   How to create your own functions to simplify and improve your code.
-   How to evaluate your code on three axes: correctness, design, and style.
-   How to integrate comments into your code.
-   How to utilize types and operators and the implications of your choices.

### Task 01: "Mario"

This program prints a pyramid of 1 to 8 bricks.

### Task 02: "Credit"

This program checks if a credit card is valid.

## Week 02: "Arrays"

Preprocessing. Compiling. Assembling. Linking. Debugging. Arrays. Strings. Command-Line Arguments. Cryptography.

In this lesson, you learned more details about compiling and how data is stored within a computer. Specifically, you learned…

-   Generally, how a compiler works.
-   How to debug your code using four methods.
-   How to utilize arrays within your code.
-   How arrays store data in back to back portions of memory.
-   How strings are simply arrays of characters.
-   How to interact with arrays in your code.
-   How command-line arguments can be passed to your programs.
-   The basic building-blocks of cryptography.

## Week 03: "Algorithms"

Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search. Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort. Asymptotic Notation (Big-O, Big-Omega, Big-Theta). Recursion.

In this lesson, you learned about algorithmic thinking and building your own data types. Specifically, you learned…

-   Algorithms.
-   Big O notation.
-   Binary search and linear search.
-   Various sort algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort.
-   Recursion.
